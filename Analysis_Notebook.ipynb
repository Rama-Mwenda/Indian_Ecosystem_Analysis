Investors provide start-ups and other entrepreneurial ventures with the capital---popularly known as \"funding\"---to think big, grow rich, and leave a lasting impact. In this project, you are going to analyse funding received by start-ups in India from 2018 to 2021. You will find the data for each year of funding in a separate csv file in the dataset provided. In these files you'll find the start-ups' details, the funding amounts received, and the investors' information.\n",

    "##### **Startup:**\n",
    "A startup or start-up is a company or project undertaken by an entrepreneur to seek, develop, and validate a scalable business model. Startups are new businesses that intend to grow large beyond the solo founder. At the beginning, startups face high uncertainty and have high rates of failure, but a minority of them do go on to become successful and influential.\n",

    "A startup ecosystem is community of people, startups in their various stages and various types of organizations (funders, governments, etc) in a location (physical or virtual), interacting as a system to create and scale new startups. \n",
    "\n",
    "Neither biological nor startup ecosystems can be created, designed or built by an outside actor. While this makes the term ‘start-up ecosystem’ hard to grasp, it does underline that start-ups operate in complex and highly dynamic environments. For this reason, it is particularly important to take sufficient time to analyse and understand the ecosystem before designing interventions to partake in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like biological ecosystems, a startup ecosystem consists of different elements, which can be individuals, groups, organisations and institutions that form a community by interacting with one another, but also environmental determinants that have an influence on how these actors work and interconnect; in startup ecosystems, these can be laws and policies or cultural norms."

    "**1. What is the Density and ecosystem value?**  \\\n",
    "A first step to mapping an ecosystem is to look at its actual size, growth, and value. This can be tracked by the number of new startups founded in a region during a specific period but also the total combined valuation of all these companies over time, and even break them down by funding year to monitor each cohort. Looking at the number of exits, especially the larger ones are also an interesting indicator of startup success.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. How does the Funding activity look in the Ecosystem?** \\\n",
    "To assess the health of a startup ecosystem we need to have an eye on the quality, quantity, and ease of access to funding. To evaluate the ease of access to funding, start tracking early-stage funding rounds. Their volume and growth over time will let us know if start-ups are getting the support they need to take their business off the ground. The location of the investors will help you to identify foreign VCs already investing in your Indian startup ecosystem and allow us to build bridges for potential collaboration and partnerships.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Market reach and scaling opportunities** \\\n",
    "The easiest way to gauge the success of your startups is to watch the unicorns (measured in terms of companies valued at over $1 billion) in your ecosystem. Although it may be a metric not relevant in the future (due to the increase in number of unicorns), it remains an interesting indicator of startup ecosystem success.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.Knowledge and innovation** \\\n",
    "Innovation and entrepreneurship often flourish alongside world-class knowledge institutes and R&D incentives. These institutions often foster high-impact innovation, collaboration, and success across sectors. You can measure the level of innovation and new technology in your local ecosystem through research and patent activity, and by keeping tabs on the number of spinouts your local knowledge institutions produce. \n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Connectedness, Talent, Diversity, and more…** \\\n",
    "A vibrant ecosystem is not simply a collection of isolated elements, the connections between the elements matter just as much as the elements themselves. The metrics for connectedness and access to quality and diverse talent are a little more complex. You could however look out for the number of accelerators & incubators in your region, on job boards to access the type of talent your startups are looking for the most and on investment heatmaps to understand the breadth of various industries or depth of expertise present in your community."
