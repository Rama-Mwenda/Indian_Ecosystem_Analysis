    "#### **Definitions** ####\n",
    "##### **Ecosystem:**\n",
    "In natural sciences, ‘ecosystems’ are generally defined as a system, or a group of interconnected elements, formed by the interaction of a community of organisms with their environment. Like biological ecosystems, an entrepreneurial ecosystem consists of different elements, which can be individuals, groups, organisations and institutions that form a community by interacting with one another, but also environmental determinants that have an influence on how these actors work and interconnect; in entrepreneurial ecosystems, these can be laws and policies or cultural norms.\n",
    "Neither biological nor entrepreneurial ecosystems can be created, designed or built by an outside actor. While this makes the term ‘entrepreneurial ecosystem’ hard to grasp, it does underline that entrepreneurship ecosystems operate in complex and highly dynamic environments. For this reason, it is particularly important to take sufficient time to analyse and understand the ecosystem before designing interventions to partake in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Startup:**\n",
    "A startup or start-up is a company or project undertaken by an entrepreneur to seek, develop, and validate a scalable business model. Startups are new businesses that intend to grow large beyond the solo founder. At the beginning, startups face high uncertainty and have high rates of failure, but a minority of them do go on to become successful and influential.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **India:**\n",
    "India, country that occupies the greater part of South Asia. India is made up of 28 states and eight union territories, and its national capital is New Delhi. It is the seventh-largest country by area and the most populous country as of June 2023."
