<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

### Scenario
Your company executives have an interest in investing in the Indian Startup Ecosystem. You have been tasked with analysing the available data from 2018 to 2021 and advice on the best course of action for the company.

### Project Structure
The project uses the CRISP-DM Framework. 
Our first part covers the Business Understanding and external research to provide a base for our work and then we head to the second phase where we look at the Datasets we have and analyse the ecosystem fully to generate insights.
We finalise by a conclsuion of what our analysis has uncovered and propose a course of action for the company
